---

## 🚦 Running the Staging Environment

The project includes a separate staging environment.

The staging environment is used to test the application before moving it to production.  
It runs separately from the regular local environment and uses different ports and a separate PostgreSQL database.

### 🧩 Staging Services

| Service | URL / Port | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🎨 Frontend Staging | `http://localhost:8080` | Runs the React frontend through Docker and Nginx. |
| 🚀 Backend Staging | `http://localhost:5051` | Runs the Express backend. |
| ❤️ Backend Health Check | `http://localhost:5051/health` | Checks if the backend and database are connected. |
| 🐘 PostgreSQL Staging | `localhost:5434` | Separate PostgreSQL database for staging. |

### ▶️ Start Staging

From the root project folder, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --build -d
```

This command builds and starts:

- 🐘 Staging PostgreSQL database
- 🚀 Staging backend
- 🎨 Staging frontend

### ❤️ Check Staging Health

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:5051/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "service": "Intelligent Investor Backend",
  "database": "Connected"
}
```

### 🎨 Open Staging Frontend

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:8080
```

If the staging database is empty, the frontend will show:

```txt
No saved profiles yet.
```

This is normal because the staging database is separate from the regular local database.

### 🛑 Stop Staging

To stop the staging environment, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml down
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Production Environment

The project includes a separate production-like Docker environment.

The production environment is used to run the project in a cleaner and more isolated setup.  
It uses separate containers, separate ports, and a separate PostgreSQL database.

### 🧩 Production Services

| Service | URL / Port | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🎨 Frontend Production | `http://localhost:8090` | Runs the React frontend through Docker and Nginx. |
| 🚀 Backend Production | `http://localhost:5052` | Runs the Express backend. |
| ❤️ Backend Health Check | `http://localhost:5052/health` | Checks if the backend and database are connected. |
| 🐘 PostgreSQL Production | `localhost:5435` | Separate PostgreSQL database for production. |

### ▶️ Start Production

From the root project folder, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

This command builds and starts:

- 🐘 Production PostgreSQL database
- 🚀 Production backend
- 🎨 Production frontend

### ❤️ Check Production Health

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:5052/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "service": "Intelligent Investor Backend",
  "database": "Connected"
}
```

### 🎨 Open Production Frontend

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:8090
```

The frontend should display:

```txt
Environment: Production
```

If the production database is empty, the frontend will show:

```txt
No saved profiles yet.
```

This is normal because the production database is separate from the local and staging databases.

### 🛑 Stop Production

To stop the production environment, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Database Migrations

The backend container runs Prisma migrations automatically when it starts:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy && node src/server.js
```

This is configured in the Docker Compose files.

It means that if a database is new or empty, Prisma automatically creates the required tables before the backend server starts.

The database includes:

- `financial_profiles`
- `spending_plans`

This behavior is used in:

- Local Docker environment
- Staging Docker environment
- Production Docker environment

---

## 🏷️ Environment Badge

The frontend displays an environment badge in the top header.

The badge helps identify which environment is currently running.

Examples:

```txt
Environment: Local
Environment: Staging
Environment: Production
```

The value is controlled by the frontend build variable:

```txt
VITE_APP_ENV
```

The value is passed during the Docker build process using build arguments in the Docker Compose files.

Regular local environment:

```yaml
args:
  VITE_API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:5050
  VITE_APP_ENV: Local
```

Staging environment:

```yaml
args:
  VITE_API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:5051
  VITE_APP_ENV: Staging
```

Production environment:

```yaml
args:
  VITE_API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:5052
  VITE_APP_ENV: Production
```

This is useful in DevOps because it makes the difference between local, staging, and production environments clear and visible in the user interface.

---

## 🧠 Why Multiple Environments Are Useful

Using multiple environments is an important DevOps practice.

This project includes three environments:

| Environment | Frontend | Backend | Database | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local | `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:5050` | `localhost:5433` | Development and regular testing |
| Staging | `http://localhost:8080` | `http://localhost:5051` | `localhost:5434` | Testing before production |
| Production | `http://localhost:8090` | `http://localhost:5052` | `localhost:5435` | Production-like isolated run |

This separation helps test the system safely without mixing data between environments.

---

## 🐳 Docker Explanation

### Container

A container is an isolated environment that runs one part of the system.

In the regular local environment:

| Container | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `intelligent_investor_frontend` | Runs the React frontend with Nginx |
| `intelligent_investor_backend` | Runs the Node.js Express backend |
| `intelligent_investor_postgres` | Runs the PostgreSQL database |

In the staging environment:

| Staging Container | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `intelligent_investor_staging_frontend` | Runs the staging React frontend with Nginx |
| `intelligent_investor_staging_backend` | Runs the staging Node.js Express backend |
| `intelligent_investor_staging_postgres` | Runs the staging PostgreSQL database |

In the production environment:

| Production Container | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `intelligent_investor_prod_frontend` | Runs the production React frontend with Nginx |
| `intelligent_investor_prod_backend` | Runs the production Node.js Express backend |
| `intelligent_investor_prod_postgres` | Runs the production PostgreSQL database |

---

### Image

An image is the template used to create a container.

Example:

```txt
postgres:16
```

This image is used to create the PostgreSQL container.

---

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile contains instructions for building an image.

This project has:

```txt
backend/Dockerfile
frontend/Dockerfile
```

The frontend Dockerfile supports environment variables during build time:

```txt
VITE_API_BASE_URL
VITE_APP_ENV
```

---

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose runs services together using configuration files.

Regular local environment:

```txt
docker-compose.yml
```

Staging environment:

```txt
docker-compose.staging.yml
```

Production environment:

```txt
docker-compose.prod.yml
```

The regular environment builds the frontend with:

```txt
VITE_APP_ENV=Local
```

The staging environment builds the frontend with:

```txt
VITE_APP_ENV=Staging
```

The production environment builds the frontend with:

```txt
VITE_APP_ENV=Production
```

This allows the frontend to display the correct environment badge.

---

### Volume

A volume stores database data permanently.

In this project, PostgreSQL volumes keep database data even if containers are stopped.

Each environment has its own separate volume, so data does not mix between local, staging, and production.

---

### 🌐 Cypress E2E Test

Make sure the full project is running first:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then run Cypress from the `frontend` folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run cy:run
```

Expected result:

```txt
Tests: 5
Passing: 5
Failing: 0
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

This project includes several layers of automated testing to verify the backend logic, API routes, frontend behavior, and full user flow.

The tests help ensure that new changes do not break the main functionality of the system.

### ✅ Test Coverage Summary

| Test Area | Tool | Location | What It Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend Unit Tests | Jest | `backend/src/tests/calculationService.test.js` | Verifies the financial calculation logic. |
| Backend Integration Tests | Jest + Supertest | `backend/src/tests/profileRoutes.test.js` | Verifies backend API routes, validation, and responses. |
| Frontend Component Test | Vitest + React Testing Library | `frontend/src/App.test.jsx` | Verifies that the React UI updates after user actions. |
| Cypress E2E Test | Cypress | `frontend/cypress/e2e/financial-profile.cy.js` | Simulates a real user flow in the browser. |
| Cypress Edge Case Tests | Cypress | `frontend/cypress/e2e/financial-profile.cy.js` | Verifies input validation and special user scenarios. |

---

### 🌐 Cypress E2E Tests

The Cypress tests simulate real user behavior inside the browser.

The main E2E test checks the full flow of the application:

```txt
1. Open the frontend application
2. Enter financial profile details
3. Click Calculate Plan
4. Verify that the spending buckets are displayed
5. Verify that the investment projection chart appears
6. Save the financial profile
7. Verify that the saved profile appears in the Saved Profiles section
```

---

### ⚠️ Cypress Edge Case Tests

In addition to the main happy-path test, the project also includes edge case tests.

These tests check how the system behaves when the user enters missing or incomplete data.

The edge case tests include:

| Edge Case | Expected Behavior |
|---|---|
| Application loads successfully | The main title, form, and buttons are visible. |
| Missing gross salary | The system displays a validation error. |
| Missing bank net | The system calculates the plan using estimated bank net from gross salary. |
| Missing name while saving | The system displays a validation error. |
| Valid profile submission | The profile is calculated, saved, and displayed correctly. |

These tests improve confidence that the application handles both normal and incorrect user actions correctly.

### ▶️ Running Cypress Tests

To run Cypress tests in headless mode:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run cy:run
```

Expected result:

```txt
Tests: 5
Passing: 5
Failing: 0
```

To open Cypress in interactive mode:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run cy:open
```
